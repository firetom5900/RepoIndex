# Repo Index

In my role with Microsoft I publish a lot of source code for workshops and hackathons.  I can't keep track of everything.  This repo is a listing of all of my public-facing repos on both github and git.davewentzel.com.  

## Why github and gitlab?

I'm often asked why I use github and git.davewentzel.com (which is gitlab).  Github has only had unlimited private repos since about late 2018.  Using self-hosted gitlab with google apps oauth2 integration was a great way to share code securely with customers when I was consultant.  I've been using gitlab since about 2011 when I needed a pragmatic way to learn Ruby.  Since then I've been a contributor to gitlab.
